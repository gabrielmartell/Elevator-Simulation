--------------------------------------
Winter 2023 COMP3004 Final Assignment
** Grade Recieved for this Assignment: 100% **

The final assignment acted as a _final_ "product" of all the assignments before.
A1 relied on the development of use cases. (100%)
A2 relied on the analysis and diagrams. (100%)
And finally, this assignment, required us to produce a working product. The pdf was all of my work on A1 and A2, and the code is the final product for A3.

Please review README.txt in content.

Thanks,
Gabe
